    "1) Large schools (with 2,000 - 5,000 students) have lower pass rates in both reading and math than small- (less than 1,000 students) and medium (between 1,000 - 2,000 students) schools, which have roughly the same pass rates in reading and math. Math passing rates are especially poor in large schools, with a roughly 69% pass rate, on average, compared to 94% for small and medium schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) In this sample, charter schools have much higher overall passing rates than district public schools. Charter schools don't see a big drop off in the pass rate between reading and math, which have 97% and 94% pass rates, respectively. But district schools, which have lower pass rates in both subjects, see a large drop off in the math pass rate (67%) versus the reading pass rate (81%). \n"
